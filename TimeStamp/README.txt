Time Tracker

Intro:
This is a simple application for people who work with multiple clients a day and have trouble tracking their time.
This will make a start and stop time punch, and also has a client text box to write in the client and a description
 of the work done. Once you hit save a file called timeStamp.txt will be saved wherever the application is saved. 
 You can delete old punches from the text file once you have them logged. It is perfect to just have running in 
 the background to help you with day to day tasks.
 
 To run application download the jar file. Wherever the jar file is located the TimeStamp.txt file will also be located
 once you initiate your first save.

This was built as a project outside of class.
